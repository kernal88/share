Ionospheric refraction
In the ionosphere which is 50 ~ 100 km from the ground, 
strong ionization generates a large amount of free electrons and positive ions from air 
molecules by celestial radiation. When the GPS signals go through the ionosphere, like 
other electromagnetic waves, the signal path will bend, the velocity will change, so that 
,the distance measurement error occurs. This is known as ionospheric refraction.
Three ways to weaken its influence are available nowadays:
1. Using dual-frequency observations. Using a combination of observations at different 
   frequencies to correct.
2. Using the ionospheric model.
3. Find difference between the simultaneous observations. This method is great for 
   short-baseline.

Tropospheric refraction
The troposphere is the lowest portion of Earth's atmosphere, 
which contains approximately 80% of the atmosphere's mass and 99% of its water vapor and 
aerosols. The average depth of the troposphere is approximately 17 km. And the atmospheric 
conditions are more complex. The troposphere gets radiation from the ground, and the 
temperature decreases with increasing height. Like what happens in the ionosphere, through 
the troposphere the GPS signal path also bend, so that the distance measurement error 
occurs again. This is tropospheric refraction.
There also three ways to weaken the influence:
1. Using the tropospheric model, whose meteorological parameters measured in the station directly.
2. Introduction the additional parameters describing the influence of the troposphere, 
   which to be estimated during data process.
3. Find difference between the simultaneous observations.

Ren Yafei and Ke Xizheng proposed one kind of simple troposphere delay revision model applied under the condition of lacking
of the actual measured meteorological parameters, based on Hopfield model and Saastamoinen model. They use Matlab to analyze 
the real measured data by the static and dynamic receivers. The experimental results indicate that the simply-revised 
model can eliminate 70% of troposphere delay effects, and the GPS positioning accuracy can be effectively imporved.


Multipath
GPS receiver receives normal signals from satellites, and reflective signals through 
buildings, water or other reflective surface. The latter is interference, which has 
longer path, producing the so called "multi-path error". Such interference and delay 
effects caused by multi-path signal propagation is called multipath.
Ways to suppress the influence:
1. Select appropriate stations. Stations should not be in hills, valleys and basins, 
   should leave the high-rise buildings.
2. Choose better receiver antenna.



《多路径效应对GPS定位影响的研究》
Guo Jingjun, Shang Ruibin, Li Yulin made a research of the multipath generated by different materials.
The multipath has some relationship with satellite vertical angle and the distance from reflectors to antenna. In diagram 1, 'D' is the distance,
'sigma' is the satellite vertical angle. The antenna gets signal L1 which is from satellite, and signal L2 which walks along S2 and S1.
It's easy to find out that:
    S1 = D / cos'sigma' 
    S2 = S1 * cos2'sigma'
    S = S1 + S2 (S is delay)
    Q = S / 'lambda' (Q is delay phase)
In diagram 2, it's the vector diagram of direct wave adding reflected wave. B is the direct, while A is the reflected, of course C is the compound:
    epsilon = arct.....
    Q is the phase dielectric between the original and the reflected
    'psi' is the phase difference between the original and the compound
    A is the swing of the reflected wave
    B is the swing of the direct wave
    C is the swing of the compound wave
'psi' can make measurement errors in two ways. One is 整周, the other is the part which not exceeding a 整周
In the formula, Q has relationship with incoming angle, A has relationship with the reflective media and the distance between antenna and the media.
To say it more precisely, resistivity effects A when the reflector is metal, dielectric constant effects A when it's nonmetal. Inside a conductor, 
the current is running, not leading to the pile of electricity. Only can we find electricity on conductor surface, and they flow the rule of exponential
attenuation. The attenuation has relationship with satellite vertical angle ('sigma') and dielectric constant ('epsilon'). 'sigma' is larger attenuation
is quicker, while 'epsilon' is larger attenuation is slower. Larger 'epsilon' means that the media is more powerful to restrict electricity, so that
the eletric field has smaller divergence, leading to the slower attenuation.
    
 

They choose woods, metals, glass and so forth as different reflectors.
According to their experiments, woods and metals can reflect GPS signals while glass does not.
The dielectric constant of woods is 6.7, which of glass is just 3.5. Wood block could effect the positioning result
in decimeter level. The multipath is definitely effected by surrounding objects, especially for metals. Because metals
can reflect electromagnetic wave totally. So antenna always has anti-metal board to suppress their influence.
The multipath of nonmetal materials are according to their dielectric constants. The constant is larger, the reflection is larger.
The dielectric constants of Wood block and sand are sort of large, so the reflected wave exists. Especially for water, it's 61.5,
makes the multipath heavily. So we should pay much attention to working around lake or river. The reflection becomes larger when
the material becomes wet, like block, sand, groud, for the sake of increasing dielectric constants respectively. So also pay attention
to the environment, especially in rain. Of course, the multipath has some relationship with the distance between antenna and reflectors.
As attenuation happens when electromagnetic wave goes through aerosphere, the attenuation formula is:
    I = Io * e ** (-D * alpha)  (最后一页)
In it 'Io' is energy in total, 'I' is the energy the antenna gets, 'D' is optical distance, 'alpha' is attenuation coefficient.
When the reflector is 20 meters away from the antenna ('alpha' gets 0.23), the attenuation is 40dB, while it becomes 100dB when the
distance is 50 meters. At this point (50 meters distance with 100dB attenuation), the reflection can be ignore. Consequently, we need 
to choose the proper distance between antenna and surroundings according to the weather (rain or not) and the material and the formula above.
